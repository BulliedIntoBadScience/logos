Our logos were designed by Dusan Rozic through a Platinum logo contest at 99designs.

Notes from Dusan about how to use the various files:
- CMYK: files for printing 
- RGB: files for digital use
- Logo_ (ai, eps, pdf, jpg, png)
- .ai can only be opened in Adobe Illustrator file
- .eps can be opened in other vector based programs (same as .pdf)
- _ trans.png is 300 dpi (highest resolution) with a transparent background

Laurent created the files starting with "hex_" for us to print hexagonal stickers at StickerMule.
